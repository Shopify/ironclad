# Quick Roadmap Reference
## What's Now vs. What's Coming

**Last Updated**: January 13, 2026

---

## ✅ Phase 1 - AVAILABLE NOW

### Contract Operations
- ✅ Search by counterparty, type, keywords
- ✅ Get contract details (including amendments/families)
- ✅ List attachments
- ✅ Count contracts (no date filter)

### Workflow Operations
- ✅ Search active workflows
- ✅ Filter by stage (Draft, Review, Sign)
- ✅ Get workflow details
- ✅ View participants & approvals

---

## 🔮 Phase 2 - PLANNED (Q2 2026)

### Clause Extraction & AI Reading
**Status**: Research phase

- "Find contracts with indemnity clauses"
- "Do we have trademark rights from [Counterparty]?"
- "Tell me about our liability obligations with Microsoft"

**Requirements**: PDF access, text extraction, AI model training

---

### Date-Filtered Analytics
**Status**: ON HOLD (pending API improvements)

- "Show me trends over 2024"
- "Compare Q3 to Q4 contracts"
- "Contracts expiring in 30 days"

**Why on hold**: Ironclad UI is faster (10s vs 30s) and more reliable

---

## 💡 Phase 3 - IDEAS (Q3-Q4 2026)

- Contract comparison (side-by-side)
- Bulk operations (export multiple contracts)
- Advanced search (Boolean operators, fuzzy matching)

---

## ❌ NOT PLANNED

- Contract editing/creation (security/compliance)
- Real-time notifications (architecture limitation)

---

## 🎯 When Users Ask About Future Features

The MCP will now automatically:
1. ✅ Tell them what phase it's in (2, 3, or not planned)
2. ✅ Provide expected timeline
3. ✅ Explain why it's not available yet
4. ✅ Suggest current alternatives (usually Ironclad UI)

**Example**:
> "Clause extraction is planned for Phase 2 (Q2 2026). Currently, use `search_contracts` to search metadata or use Ironclad UI to search PDFs directly."
